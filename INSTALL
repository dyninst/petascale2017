At some point, you will receive an email from Bart that contains an email template with the cost
numbers for this year. Once you have that data, complete the steps below to create a new site.

0. Clone the https://github.com/dyninst/scalable_tools_workshop repo to your local machine

1. copy the previous year's "petascale20XX" directory to "petascale20YY"

2. copy the previous year's "_data/workshop20XX" directory to "_data/workshop20YY"

3. Run "sudo apt-get install ruby-dev bundle" to install (or update) the ruby environment

4. In _config.yml, change scope/path and values/year to reflect the directory changes you made in (1) and (2)

5. Change the group code in petascale20YY/registration.md

6. Add links to the previous year's page in petascale20YY/workshops.md

7. Add the new pricings in _data/workshop20YY/prices.yml

8. Update the schedule in _data/workshop20YY/schedule.yml
    a. Remove all of the old talk hash entries (just the talks! Don't change any of the other keys for a session!)

9. Update the "Nth Scalable Tools Workshop" in index.md

10. Use the instructions from the site below to install the bundles and generate a new site.
    You don't need to do any of the optional items
    https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll

11. Delete Gemfile.lock

12. Run "bundle exec jekyll serve"
    a. If you saw no errors from jekyll and all of the content looks correct, then you can push it to GitHub.
    b. If you get errors, you will have to search on how to fix them. The template language is Liquid and the
       web framework is Jekyll. It's all written in ruby.

13. On your local machine, set up the AFS web directory
    a. cd /p/paradyn/public/html
    b. cp -R petascale20XX petascale20YY

You should now see your updated site at http://www.paradyn.org/petascale20YY.

-- !If you receive an email from Github about security vulnerabilities

1. Clone the https://github.com/dyninst/scalable_tools_workshop repo to your local machine (if it's not already there)

2. Delete Gemfile.lock

3. Update the entries in Gemfile as suggested by Github
    b. e.g., gem "jekyll", ">= 3.6.3"

4. Re-run step (13) from above
